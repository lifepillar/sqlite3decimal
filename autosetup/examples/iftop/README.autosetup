----------------------------

This is an example of rewriting the iftop configure.in for autosetup

This is not complete, since configure.in attempts to run a number of tests
which autosetup does not allow.

Also, iftop uses automake, so there is no standalone Makefile.in

Run autosetup --install; ./configure
