----------------------------

This example is from tcllib 1.7

The configure script here really doesn't do very much, but
is notable in that it does not use any checks based on the C compiler.

The development version of autosetup is installed.

The Makefile.in was tweaked slightly to reconfigure with autosetup
rather than config.status

Run: ./configure
